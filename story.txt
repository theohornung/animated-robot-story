There once was an animator named Geoffery. He was an lazy worker that had little success in his professional career. To put it plainly, he was bad at his job. One day, he went to an animation competition to try and prove himself. Geoffery had spent the past month wracking his brains for something to animate, and he had finally decided on a robot. On that morning, he walked into the convention center, only to be instantly dismayed by the thousands of other animators and artists that also competing. He walked through the front doors into the main building, and sat in a corner, nervously waiting for the event to start.
