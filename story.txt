There once was an animator named Geoffery. He was an lazy worker that had little success in his professional career. To put it plainly, he was bad at his job. One day, he went to an animation competition to try and prove himself. Geoffery had spent the past month wracking his brains for something to animate, and he had finally decided on a robot. On that morning, he walked into the convention center, only to be instantly dismayed by the thousands of other animators and artists that also competing. He walked through the front doors into the main building, and sat in a corner, nervously waiting for the event to start.

Suddenly a chiwawa appeared bathed in heavenly glow. He told Geoffery that he had great talents in him. Talents so great that a sorceress had cursed him to stay lazy for she had feared his powers.The chiwawa told the animator that he possesed the power to get inside any animation or dimension he liked. The chiwawa then lifted his curse of laziness and set Geofferey free. The first thing that the animator did is that he went inside old yeller and saved the dog from getting shot.
